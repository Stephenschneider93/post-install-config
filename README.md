In my OSticket account I’m starting at roles. Which are permissions given out to users depending on their position depending on what department they’re in. I’m acting agent in OS ticket, so I go to the role tab and create a new role called, “Supreme Admin”. From there I can enable or disable permissions at my discretion. From there I click on the agent’s tab, then departments, where I am shown existing departments such as Maintenance and Support. I have created a new department called System Administrators. I then want to create a team, so I click the Teams tab that displays all teams, which only consists of Level I Support. So, I added a team called Level II Support where I made myself the Team Lead as you can see in the screenshot above.

I then want to allow anyone the ability to create tickets. So, I go to the user’s settings where I can confirm that “require registration and login to create tickets” is unchecked, which allows anyone to create tickets. I then created agents to answer incoming tickets, so I clicked the agent tab and typed in basic information to create Jane and John. I can put them into any department I choose, as well as dictate their permissions. I then create users that can send tickets to my agents when encountering a work-related computer issue, which are named Karen and Ken. I now want to create SLA (Service Level Agreement) plans to dictate the priority and timely manner that a ticket needs to be resolved per the company protocols. As you can see from the screenshot above.
